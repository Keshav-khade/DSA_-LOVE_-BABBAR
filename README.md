# DSA-100Days Challenge

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) learning repository!  

Currently, I am learning DSA concepts and practicing problems to improve my problem-solving skills.  
All the code is written using **VS Code** and regularly pushed to this GitHub repository for tracking progress.

## What you'll find here

- Solutions to various DSA problems from popular platforms
- Implementation of common data structures and algorithms
- Practice problems organized by topics (arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)

## How I use this repo

- Write code for each problem in VS Code
- Test and debug solutions locally
- Commit and push updates to keep track of progress

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in DSA
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming
- Maintain a clean and organized codebase on GitHub
